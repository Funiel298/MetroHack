                    <h3>1. Explain React Native?</h3>
                    <p>React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework introduced by Facebook. It is used for developing a real, native mobile application for iOS and Android platforms. It uses only JavaScript to build a mobile app. It is like React, which uses native components rather than using web components as building blocks. It is cross-platform, which allows you to write code once and can run on any platform.

                        React Native application is based on React, a JavaScript library developed by Facebook and XML-Esque markup (JSX) for creating the user interface. It targets the mobile platform rather than the browser. It saves your development time as it allows you to build apps by using a single language JavaScript for both Android and iOS platforms.</p>
